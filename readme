Employee attrition, the departure of employees from an organization, poses a significant challenge for businesses. 
This project explores the application of advanced unsupervised learning techniques—Isolation Forest and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)—to unravel patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition. 
Isolation Forest identifies anomalous behavior, while GMM provides insights into employee clusters. The study employs the Elbow Method, K-means Clustering with PCA, K-means Clustering with t-SNE, and LOF outliers with PCA to unveil patterns and clusters. 
These techniques aid in optimal cluster determination, segmentation insights, and anomaly detection. Understanding employee attrition dynamics is vital for organizations aiming to develop effective strategies and ensure long-term organizational success.
