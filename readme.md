# Employee Attrition Analysis
Employee attrition, the departure of employees from an organization, presents a significant challenge for businesses. This project delves into the application of advanced unsupervised learning techniques—Isolation Forest and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)—to uncover patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition.

## Overview
- **Isolation Forest:** Identifies anomalous behavior within the employee dataset.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):** Provides insights into employee clusters.

## Methodology
The study employs the following techniques:

- **Elbow Method:** For optimal cluster determination.
- **K-means Clustering with PCA:** Unveils patterns using principal component analysis.
- **K-means Clustering with t-SNE:** Reveals clusters using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
- **LOF Outliers with PCA:** Detects anomalies using local outlier factor and principal component analysis.
These techniques contribute to optimal cluster determination, segmentation insights, and anomaly detection, providing a comprehensive understanding of employee attrition dynamics. Such insights are vital for organizations aiming to develop effective strategies and ensure long-term organizational success.
